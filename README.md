#  Neural network based Four switch Three Phase Inverter using SVPWM




## PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS


- MATLAB R2021

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

```
The project aims at studying and developing the Simulink model for the four-switch space
vector based PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) three-phase inverter. The proposed model
was first developed using MATLAB R2021 and the outputs were then fed to the neural
network using the NN toolbox.
